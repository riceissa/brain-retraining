# Introduction

(This introduction is ironically way too long since in worst stages of my illness when I first started doing brain retraining, I would not have been able to read this much text. I plan to eventually make an audio version of this introduction, to minimize the amount of text one needs to read.)

The biggest barrier that stopped me from trying brain retraining for so long is the cost of the programs. I don't want cost to be a barrier for other people, so I've made this playlist consisting entirely of freely available YouTube videos. You might think that freely available means lower quality, but actually, I think this playlist is _better_ than any single program, because different presenters have different strengths whereas I get to pick the best videos from each presenter. You don't need to join a program or pay huge sums of money to recover.

This playlist contains the most important insights that _I_ needed to get on the path to recovery, but it's likely that what I needed is different from what other people need, so this playlist is intended more as a jumping-off point into the world of brain retraining and other mind body approaches, rather than an exhaustive list that has all that you need.

In cases where the video titles seemed uninformative or clickbaity (e.g. stuff like "The #1 secret to recovery"), I've substituted my own title, but of course you can see the original title by clicking through to the video. I've also downcased obnoxious all-caps in titles.

Some of the videos have a branding on pain/only mention pain, but they mostly apply to non-pain symptoms as well.

I sometimes link to videos on YouTube that are part of a (YouTube) playlist rather than individual videos. You don't need to watch the whole (YouTube) playlist. I linked to the (YouTube) playlist version so that in case you really like a video, you can easily find some similar videos by scrolling around in the (YouTube) playlist.

I recommend watching about 1–3 videos per day. Watch all the videos on this playlist and once you are done, rewatch them all again. I can't emphasize enough how important it is to just keep watching these videos over and over again. It takes time for your brain to really grok recovery. Eventually your brain _will_ get it.

As the Gupta Program says, I highly recommend making at least a 6 month commitment to brain retraining (i.e. do it for 6 months even if you don't see any improvements; recovery itself can take longer than 6 months), because it can take quite some time for you to understand what brain retraining is and for the benefits to show up. If you don't commit to it, you may end up dismissing it before you've truly understood it or before it has had time to work. If 6 months sounds like a lot of time and you would rather focus on other treatment approaches first, I would say go try the other treatments first, and only come back to brain retraining once you are ready to commit to it for 6 months. By the time I came to brain retraining, I was ill for 5 years, had tried a bunch of other unsuccessful treatments, my doctors had no other treatment options available for me, and I was too ill to go into a doctor's office or do telehealth visits anyway, so 6 months of sitting at home and watching videos and doing techniques did not seem like a big commitment to me.

A lot of these videos are repetitive (both within a single video, and cross videos). This is on purpose. A lot of people with these conditions (including me) have brain fog, and even if they don't, the symptoms make it difficult to concentrate. By hearing the same message over and over, in different contexts, is what gets your brain to finally internalize the message.

In some of the videos, the science of the brain is probably wrong, possibly in major misleading ways. The mechanistic explanations might be off. But that doesn't mean the techniques don't work. You don't need to be an expert in neuroscience, immunology, or whatever in order to recover, and the people presenting this information don't need to be experts either in order to teach you how to recover. So my advice is to treat brain retraining more like an advanced art that has been stumbled onto and practiced and refined by various people, that science still doesn't quite understand (but will eventually!).

One last note before you get started watching the videos. Most of the videos I link to were created by people who also happen to offer paid service (like a paid program or paid coaching). Some of the recovery stories are also from people who offer paid services. I realize a lot of people (including me, if someone had shown me this playlist before I really got into brain retraining) will find this suspicious: are these people just posting these videos to "trick" people into signing up for their paid programs? Are these videos just part of a "scam"? My own take is that the information is valid regardless of what other things these people do. Just focus on the free videos in this playlist, and you will probably be able to fully recover.

Visualization can be helpful for a lot of people during recovery, but just like meditation, breathing techniques, etc., I don't think it's necessary. The most important thing is to respond well to your symptoms.
