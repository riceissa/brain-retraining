I mostly just want people to watch the videos on my [playlist](playlist.md),
but the playlist might be a bit confusing for people because sometimes the
different people whose videos are on the playlist disagree with each other. So
in so far as the people on my playlist disagree, here's where I stand:

- On theory, I agree most with Gupta and Miguel. I agree less with Dan, because
  he mostly focuses on pain (even though he says that what he says applies to
  other symptoms, I think this is less true for the theory than the practice).
  In particular, I think there really is something going on in the body; it's
  not all just in the mind (except for certain symptoms like pain), and the
  symptoms aren't "just" false alarms (although I do think that is _part_ of
  what's going on; I've definitely had symptoms happen where the only plausible
  explanation is that I was freaking out and making it happen). But "the
  symptoms aren't dangerous, it's a false alarm" is easier to wrap your head
  around than "the symptoms _are_ real and some of them are dangerous, but
  they're only there because you reacted poorly to them the last $n$ times they
  showed up".

- I disagree with Helmut on the necessity of suffering tons to get better. I
  agree with Miguel more that you can find your baseline level of symptoms (by
  relaxing the nervous system enough), and then go just +3/10 on your symptoms
  into an adjustment period. No need to go higher; it's counter-productive.

- On reason for pacing: Obviously Dan's "Let's not freak the brain out by
  suddenly running a marathon" matters, but I agree more with Gupta that there
  really is a physical element to the condition, so you need to pace for that
  reason as well. In other words, if you suddenly run a marathon, you really
  will crash because your fatigue is real, it's not just in your mind.

- James doesn't really focus on brain retraining per se as I see what brain
  retraining is. So that is a downside. But he focuses a lot on some of the
  other aspects of recovery well.

- Miguel (and by lineage, Danny) is the only one that has the adjustment
  periods/progress cycles concept, and I think it's crucial. I plateaued for a
  month around October 2024 because I didn't have these concepts. I disagree
  with Gupta's views on dips as 'unfortunate but probable, and it's okay if
  they happen' attitude. Dips (i.e., adjustment periods) are _on_ the way to
  recovery, not in the way, as Miguel likes to say.

- However, unlike Miguel's take on APs, I think APs are "fake", in the sense
  that your brain has just temporarily really strongly convinced itself you're
  suddenly in more danger (but in reality you actually aren't). I've had at
  least three instances spanning across months of time now where I just spent
  days going around telling people "I'm in an AP" (or something similar). It
  really _felt_ like my symptoms were flaring for understandable reasons (I
  over did it, I was exposed to X stimulus, etc.). I kept telling myself this
  kind of story. But in my experience resting doesn't actually help -- it just
  makes me more conscious of the symptoms and I just ruminate and get worse and
  worse. The right mental motion instead seems to be (at least for me), just
  saying "The AP is not real, the AP is BULLSHIT". And then just doing
  something I enjoy (which can admittedly be hard to find). So APs are a useful
  concept but also they don't exist (what?)!

  I think Miguel's followers "reify" APs too much. It turns into this big thing
  in their mind (and my mind; I still need to work on this). Of course, you are
  taught to be like "well this is an opportunity for growth, I can overcome the
  AP". But that's still giving it too much power! THE AP IS NOT REAL!

- I disagree with Gupta and DNRS on the 7 steps/super involved "rounds" that
  you have to do in these programs. I think the simple Dan/Miguel/Helmut
  approach works much better for me. But I can see how this can be an
  individual thing, and that some people will find faster improvement or
  greater comfort with a more methodical step-by-step algorithm.
