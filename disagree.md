I mostly just want people to watch the videos on my [playlist](playlist.md),
but the playlist might be a bit confusing for people because sometimes the
different people whose videos are on the playlist disagree with each other. So
in so far as the people on my playlist disagree, here's where I stand:

- On theory, I agree most with Gupta and Miguel. I agree less with Dan, because
  he mostly focuses on pain (even though he says that what he says applies to
  other symptoms, I think this is less true for the theory than the practice).
  In particular, I think there really is something going on in the body; it's
  not all just in the mind (except for certain symptoms like pain), and the
  symptoms aren't "just" false alarms (although I do think that is _part_ of
  what's going on; I've definitely had symptoms happen where the only plausible
  explanation is that I was freaking out and making it happen). But "the
  symptoms aren't dangerous, it's a false alarm" is easier to wrap your head
  around than "the symptoms _are_ real and some of them are dangerous, but
  they're only there because you reacted poorly to them the last $n$ times they
  showed up".

- I disagree with Helmut on the necessity of suffering tons to get better. I
  agree with Miguel more that you can find your baseline level of symptoms (by
  relaxing the nervous system enough), and then go just +3/10 on your symptoms
  into an adjustment period. No need to go higher; it's counter-productive.

- On reason for pacing: Obviously Dan's "Let's not freak the brain out by
  suddenly running a marathon" matters, but I agree more with Gupta that there
  really is a physical element to the condition, so you need to pace for that
  reason as well. In other words, if you suddenly run a marathon, you really
  will crash because your fatigue is real, it's not just in your mind.

- James doesn't really focus on brain retraining per se as I see what brain
  retraining is. So that is a downside. But he focuses a lot on some of the
  other aspects of recovery well.

- Miguel (and by lineage, Danny) is the only one that has the adjustment
  periods/progress cycles concept, and I think it's crucial. I plateaued for a
  month around October 2024 because I didn't have these concepts. I disagree
  with Gupta's views on dips as 'unfortunate but probable, and it's okay if
  they happen' attitude. Dips (i.e., adjustment periods) are _on_ the way to
  recovery, not in the way, as Miguel likes to say.

- I disagree with Gupta and DNRS on the 7 steps/super involved "rounds" that
  you have to do in these programs. I think the simple Dan/Miguel/Helmut
  approach works much better for me. But I can see how this can be an
  individual thing, and that some people will find faster improvement or
  greater comfort with a more methodical step-by-step algorithm.
