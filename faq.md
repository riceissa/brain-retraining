# What even is brain retraining?

Brain retraining is a treatment modality for chronic illnesses including
ME/CFS, MCAS, POTS, mold illness, long COVID, post-viral illness, and more. It
involves no medications or fancy equipment. Instead, it is a body of techniques
and mindset designed to convince your brain to turn off your symptoms.

# Why is it called "brain retraining"?

The idea is that in having the chronic illness, your brain has "learned" (i.e.
been "trained" to engage in) various unhealthy habits such as turning on
symptoms to "keep you safe", become hypervigilant to stimuli, etc. What brain
retraining does is to "undo" these unhealthy habits, i.e., you are re-training
your brain.

# What do you actually do in brain retraining?

Different programs and coaches/teachers emphasize different activities, but
some of the things you might do:

- CBT-style thought stopping
- Positive self-talk
- "Neurolinguistic programming" (affirmations, changing the language you use to talk about your illness)
- Gentle movement (e.g. stretching or yoga)
- Meditation
- Laughing yoga
- Somatic tracking
- IFS-style partwork

Kind of like meditation, some people go hard in on one or a few of the
activities, while other people like to do a bunch of different things. It
really depends on what personally makes _you_ feel safe. My sense is that each
person discovers what works for them. What unites all of the activities is in
the _effect_ they are intended to produce: turn down the brain's perception of
danger, and send messages of safety.

# Is brain retraining woo?

It depends on what you mean by "woo"! If by "woo" you mean "stuff inspired by
eastern spiritual traditions", then yes. But if by "woo" you mean "stuff that
violates the laws of physics", then no.

# Aren't brain retraining programs scams/snake oil?

My take is that it varies _a lot_ by program and coach/teacher. Some programs
cost a lot of money (hundreds of dollars a month or more). Some programs charge
hundreds of dollars just to provide access to pre-recorded or low-interactivity
videos. My opinion is that these programs are exploitative of ill people, and
I do not like them, even though I also believe that most of them convey useful
information for recovery. On the other hand, there are programs that charge
reasonable fees (e.g. analogous to other human services like tutoring), and
many people on YouTube releasing videos completely for free.

# How is brain retraining different from graded exercise therapy (GET)?

Both brain retraining and GET emphasize gradually increasing your (physical,
mental, emotional) activity levels. However, the big differences are:

- In GET, you typically follow some pre-defined schedule of increasing
  activity, and you have to keep following the plan even if you feel like it's
  too much. In brain retraining, there is no pre-defined schedule; instead you
  increase until you get some symptoms, and then you pull back.
- In GET, there is no mental or emotional aspect to the activity increase. The
  model is that you're just a sack of meat that experiences symptoms, so let's
  make you do more stuff gradually. In brain retraining, the mental and
  emotional aspect is primary: you don't _just_ increase activities, you
  increase activities while teaching yourself that the activities are safe and
  that you can handle them.

# I already meditate and do breathing exercises; how will brain retraining help me?

Most meditation and breathwork traditions don't emphasize "teaching the brain
that you are safe" as the main thing you are doing. Instead they focus more on
things like spiritual enlightenment and feeling calmer. While those things are
helpful for recovery, they probably won't be sufficient on their own for a full
recovery.

# How long will it take to recover?

It depends a lot on various factors like:

- how long you've been ill
- how severe your illness is

From what I've seen, even the most severe people who've been ill for many years
tend to recover within about 3 years.

# What conditions does brain retraining treat?

It has been reported to work on illnesses such as ME/CFS, MCAS, POTS, mold
illness, long COVID, post-viral illness, multiple chemical sensitivity, chronic
pain of all sorts, PPPD and other dizziness issues, OCD, anxiety, and much
more.

# Isn't it suspicious that brain retraining works for so many different chronic conditions?

It sure is, and I don't deny that it is suspicious. My current take is that
different people are more likely to feel danger expressed in their bodies in
different ways. For example, before a public speech, one person might feel
queasy while another person might feel shoulder tension, while still another
person might feel like their heart is beating out of their chest. Isn't it
weird that even though all three people are simply nervous to give a speech,
their nervousness is expressed in all these different ways? These chronic
illnesses that are treated by brain retraining are essentially the same as
these normal physiological responses -- just on steroids.

Another thing that is going on is what John Sarno called the "symptom
imperative" -- when you become convinced that one symptom is mind-created, your
brain will turn off that symptom and then turn on a different symptom, just to
make sure you continue to freak out.

# Will brain retraining work for _me_?

That is very hard to say in a generic document such as this one. If you have
already gotten checked out by multiple mainstream Western-medicine doctors, and
they say that nothing is wrong with you, or they don't know what's wrong with
you, or they give you treatments and none of them work, then it is pretty
likely that brain retraining will work for you.

If you have been seen by functional medicine providers, and their only
explanation for your symptoms are things like "candida", "gut dysbiosis",
"MCAS", then that is also likely that brain retraining will work for you.

# Do I have to join a brain retraining program?

No! I recommend starting with my [playlist](playlist.md), which consists of
completely freely available videos.

# Why do I have to commit for 6 months?

Brain retraining is not a quick fix. It can take time to teach your frightened
brain that you are safe. 6 months is what a lot of programs recommend as enough
time to see noticeable improvements.

# Are you telling me my symptoms are all in my head?

Not at all! The symptoms are real, but

- their root cause might not be in the body
- they may have a root cause in the body but still benefit from brain retraining

# What is an adjustment period?

# What is a progress cycle?

# Surely recovery can't be that simple, can it? "Respond well to your symptoms"? Are you serious?

I am completely serious! It takes time to wrap your head around the idea. But
once you "get it", it will not seem absurd. Your brain is terrified of the
symptoms and of doing activities, and it stumbled onto the solution of giving
you _more_ symptoms to keep you safe. Recovery consists of undoing that
unconscious habit, and instead seeing the symptoms as not dangerous.

# Do I need to meditate? Do I need to do breathing exercises?

Not at all. Many people find these things helpful, but if they stress you out
then it is better to not do them. The whole point of brain retraining is to
teach you that you are safe. If you burden yourself with a checklist of
activities that you "have to" do every day, that is the opposite of safety!

# Does brain retraining involve reality denial / telling lies to myself like "I'm healthy and there's nothing wrong with my body"? And that reality denial might work a little bit, but then invariably leads to a huge crash after a bit of time, right?

My impression is that some programs might do things like this (I have heard the
Lightning Process in particular might do something like this, but I have never
done that program). The videos I link in my playlist do not involve any reality
denial.

# How do I find my baseline and do brain retraining if I have a full-time job, have children to take care of, or otherwise have stuff that I "need" to do that takes a lot of energy?

# How is brain retraining different from box breathing and other anxiety techniques?

The biggest difference is the mindset/intention. In box breathing and other
anxiety techniques, you typically do them to _get rid of_ the symptoms. You
hate the symptoms and you say "get away from me! ok I'll do this technique to
_remove_ the symptom". Not so with brain retraining. The brain retraining way
is to understand _why_ the symptom is there (to keep you safe) and to thank
your brain for doing its work, but remind it that the symptoms are not
necessary to keep you safe because you are already safe. By doing this mental
judo consistently, your brain learns to turn off the symptoms.

# I feel overwhelmed by all of the brain retraining content and techniques out there. What should I focus on?

Focus on the videos in
[this section](playlist.md#main-practice-respond-well-to-symptoms).
